# CS4261_First_Programming_Assignment

This is my first time using GitHub and Xcode

The app runs as a basic war card game that compares the randomly generated card values and increments the player and CPU scores.
I wanted to add log in/sign up pages before getting into the game to add in the backend database, but I was not aware that different app types may not work together.
The tutorial I was following for the war game was a basic app that used struct ContentView: View.
The tutorial for the log in/sing up screens used class ViewController: UIViewController.
I would like to learn more about how to combine these into a working app but it is a little over my head currently and will likely take me more time to figure out.

I was also having a difficult time downloading CocoaPods and creating a Podfile. I was trying to debug why this is not working but started to run out of time.
Most of my time was used focusing on watching tutorials and learning the basics of UI design.
More of my time will be dedicated to implementing the backend and learning how to use Firebase.
