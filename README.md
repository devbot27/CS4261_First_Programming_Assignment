# CS4261_First_Programming_Assignment

This is my first time using GitHub and Xcode

The app runs as a basic war card game that compares the randomly generated card values and increments the player and CPU scores.
I wanted to add log in/sign up pages before getting into the game to add in the backend database, but I was not aware that different app types may not work together.
The tutorial I was following for the war game was a basic app that used struct ContentView: View
The tutorial for the log in/sing up screens used class ViewController: UIViewController
I would like to learn more about how to combine these into a working app but it is a little over my head currently and will likely take me more time to figure out.
